#CGW
## What is a CGW
A gateway is a network point that acts as access to another network. With the help of the CLOUDS gateway, you can Enable and Disable your gateway. You can also select different modes.
It has different modes (1) Global mode (2) Full mode and (3) Selective mode.
### Global mode
As much as there will be global traffic. Global means that whatever traffic outside will be through the CGW.
### Full mode
Full mode means all global, local, and domain traffic will be through the CGW.
### Selective mode
The website and domain you select will use the CGW and the rest will use the local.
## Why do need a CGW
Gateways play a crucial role in CLOUD computing by facilitating communication and data transfer between disparate networks, making it possible for different systems to work together seamlessly. A Gateway can enable communication between different networks, facilitating data transfer and integration.
## CGW Enable
Before enabling the cloud gateway, it is necessary to connect the CE and PE. So first check if CE and PE are connected or not.
