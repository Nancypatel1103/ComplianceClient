## What is CE
CE stands for Customer Edge or Customer Equipment. It refers to the router used by users that connects to their ISP (Internet Service Provider) lines. A CE device serves as a router and firewall, providing various functionalities to the users.
## Why we need to CE
CE devices play a crucial role in establishing and managing the network connection between the user's premises and the ISP. They are responsible for routing network traffic, implementing network security measures, and providing network address translation (NAT) functionality.

## How to open web terminal
**Lusy**: While OpenWrt can be managed completely using SSH and the terminal, the LuCI WebUI makes many administration tasks easier. The OpenWrt full releases, such as the current 21.02.x series, ship with the LuCI WebUI installed. But for lower-memory devices, such as those with 4MBytes Flash and/or 32MBytes of RAM, the full install may fail because of lacking sufficient Flash memory so you will have to build your own image with LuCI included. More info on this can be obtained here.

1. Click on the earth located on the right side of your Device.
