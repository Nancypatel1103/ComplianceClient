# Hotspot 2.0

## What is a Hotspot 2.0
Hotspot 2.0, also known as Passpoint, is a Wi-Fi standard designed to simplify and secure Wi-Fi access. Through the use of WPA2-Enterprise protection and a robust authentication system, users can connect to Wi-Fi networks automatically and without difficulty.

## Why do we need a Hotspot 2.0
Hotspot 2.0 is essential because it enhances the user experience by providing automatic, secure, and seamless Wi-Fi connectivity. The elimination of manual authentication and logins, the isolation of cellular data to minimize network congestion, as well as the maintenance of consistent secure connections through WPA2-Enterprise, all contribute to the protection of privacy and safeguard against unauthorized access.

## How to create a Hotspot 2.0
1. Go to **(https://devic.elemprin.com/#/login)**. After filling in the details click on the **Login** button.
