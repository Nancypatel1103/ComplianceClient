# License Expiry

## What is License Expires
An expired license refers to the end of the period for a software license. As most software is only leased to the user, an expired license means that the rights given to the user are legally not applicable. Time-bound licensing refers mainly to trial licenses, subscriptions, and other kinds of agreements between the user and the software provider.

## Why do we need License Expires
The license should be expired to maintain the agreed legal and contracted agreement on software usage. This is a form of control and management by the software provider in the distribution of the products and compliance with the payment and upgrade requirements. This also keeps the users up-to-date with the newest version, with the newest security-enhancing updates.

## How to know when a License Expires
1. When you logged you will get a message shown on the screen like this. Which is a warning message. This will show that **your trial licenses are expired in 29d 0h 14m 39s. Please contact your support team to renew the license**.
2. In this way a warning message will be shown on the screen. That your license expires after 30 days. So renew it.

3. And if you go to log in after 30 days and the license has expired and you don't renew then you will get an error popup open and there error shows as shown in the image. You will not be able to log in. For that contact the support team and renew the license.
