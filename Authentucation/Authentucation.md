# Authentication

## What is an Authentication
The process of confirming a user's or entity's identity when they want to access a system, network, or resource is called authentication. To ensure permitted access, it entails verifying the user's credentials—password and username, for example—against recorded information.
## Why do we need an Authentication
For the purpose of maintaining security and restricting access to private data or resources, authentication is essential. It contributes to preventing unwanted access, and protecting privacy and data integrity. Authentication improves system security, reduces the possibility of data breaches, and guards against malevolent or unauthorized activity by authenticating users.
