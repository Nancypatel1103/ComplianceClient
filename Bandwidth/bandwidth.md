# Bandwidth

## What is a Bandwidth
Bandwidth refers to the maximum rate of data transfer across a network or internet connection. It is often measured in bits per second (bps) or multiples of bits per second such as kilobits per second (Kbps), megabits per second (Mbps), or gigabits per second (Gbps).
## Why do we need Bandwidth
Bandwidth is essential for ensuring efficient communication and data transfer within networks. Sufficient bandwidth allows for faster data transmission, smoother streaming of multimedia content, quicker loading times for web pages, and overall better performance of network-connected devices and applications.
## How to create Bandwidth
1. Go to **SSIDs**. After going to **SSIDs** click on the edit button of **SSID**.
