# Dashboard
## What is a Dashboard
A dashboard is a graphical user interface that offers a visually appealing summary of metrics, data summaries, and key performance indicators. It usually compiles data from multiple sources into a single display, making it easy for consumers to track and evaluate data patterns.                
## Why do we need a Dashboard
Dashboards are crucial instruments for making decisions because they let users evaluate the health and effectiveness of organizations, processes, or systems in real time. They support data-driven decision-making, offer real-time insights, and assist in identifying areas in need of maintenance or improvement. Dashboards improve communication within teams and departments, expedite information access, and increase openness.
