# Radio Accounting


## What is a Radio Accounting
The management of wireless network services is referred to as radio accounting. Tracking data, such as connections, session length, and sent data among other relevant metrics, is included in this. This information is typically collected by a Remote (Authentication) Dial-In Service (RADIUS) server, which helps to ensure the safe and efficient use of network resources.      
## Why do we need Radio Accounting
Radio accounting has several advantages, including network management, which enables network administrators to monitor and manage network usage to ensure optimal performance and resource allocation. This is achieved through radio accounting. By analyzing the user activity of users, radio accounting helps to identify and mitigate security risks. Business networks send invoices to ensure accurate billing. Ensures regulatory compliance by providing comprehensive information on network performance.
