## What is CGW
A gateway is a network point that acts as access to another network. With the help of the CLOUDS gateway, you can Enable and Disable your gateway. You can also select different modes. It has different modes (1) Global mode: As much as there will be global traffic. Global means that whatever traffic outside will be through the CGW. (2) Full mode: Full mode means all global, local, and domain traffic will be through the CGW. and (3) Selective mode: The website and domain you select will use the CGW and the rest will use the local.

## Why do we need a CGW
Gateways play a crucial role in CLOUD computing by facilitating communication and data transfer between disparate networks, making it possible for different systems to work together seamlessly. A Gateway can enable communication between different networks, facilitating data transfer and integration.

## How Enable CGW
Before enabling the cloud gateway, it is necessary to connect the CE and PE. So first check if CE and PE are connected or not. If the CE and PE are not connected then what to do is explained below.

1. Go to beta1. hi-clouds (https://beta1.hi-clouds.com/login) and **SIGN IN** by entering the admin permission username and password.

## Conclusion
As the most important network component of cloud computing, a Cloud Gateway (CGW) provides important capabilities for simplifying and managing the network-to-network link. The CGW enables versatility in routing traffic based on specific needs by allowing users toÂ enable and disable the router and select among Global, Full, and Selective modes.
